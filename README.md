## Introduction
React is a front-end web library that is used to create modern web apps, and in this project, I am trying to learn how we can integrate with backend API by using fetch Web API.
Therefore I have created a small backend code which has been written by node.js 

## Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bahaabakri/react-http-request.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the front-end project:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Run the back-end project:
   ```bash
   node backend/app.js
   ```
